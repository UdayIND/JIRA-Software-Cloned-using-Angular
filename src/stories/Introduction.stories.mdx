# Welcome to Angular Jira Clone Storybook

## What is Storybook

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

## What is Angular Jira Clone

There have been a handful of cool Jira-cloned apps written in `React`/`VueJS`, which makes me wonder **Why not Angular**? And here you go.
This is not only a simplified Jira clone built with Angular, but also an example of a **modern**, **real-world** Angular codebase.
